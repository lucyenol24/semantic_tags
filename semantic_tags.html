        <p><u>Mount Rainier</u> is the most famous of the Washington Mountains. Standing at 14,410 feet, only those who are skilled in mountaineering can even attempt to summit this beauty.</p>

        <p><u>Mount Shuksan</u> is my personal favorite of the three listed mountains. It is beautiful, but dangerous. It is easily viewed from Mt. Baker ski area, as well as Artist Point nearby.</p>

        <p>Climbing mountains in Washington is an incredibly rewarding, but dangerous sport. It is important to know how to climb before attempting to summit any of these mountains. A great place to learn how to not only alpine climb, but to learn rock climbing, navigation, and alpine first aid, is the Mountaineers Club in Seattle, Washington.<hr>The Mountaineers are a volunteer-based group of outdoorsy folks who dedicate their time to helping others enjoy the outdoors in a fun and safe manner. If you become a member, a year long alpine climbing class is only $500, taught by some of the most experienced climbers around. Fred Beckey, a famous rock climber, is a member of the club and often shows up at the free climbs.</p>
